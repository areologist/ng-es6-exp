# NG-ES6-EXP

**WIP** - Just trying out a variant of my preferred ng1 build.

* Angular 1.5, ES2015, RxJS-ES
* Babel, Stage-1
* ESLint, Airbnb style
* ESDoc
* Jest
* Webpack
* New way of incorporating Bootstrap
* ui-bootstrap

## Setting Up

Install npm packages by running the following from project root
directory where `package.json` resides.

```cli
npm install
```

To test that the environment is working properly run the following.

```cli
npm run build
```

Or run `npm start` if you want lint, test, build, and dev server.

**Other Stuff**

`npm test` to run jest.
`npm docs` to generate docs in `esdoc/` directory.
`npm lint` to lint.
and so on.

Run `jest -o` to only test changes.
