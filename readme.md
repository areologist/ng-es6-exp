# NG-ES6-EXP

WIP. Just trying out a variant of my preferred ng1 build.

* Angular 1.5, ES2015, RxJS-ES
* Babel, Stage-1
* ESLint, Airbnb style
* ESDoc
* Jest
* Webpack
* New way of incorporating Bootstrap
* ui-bootstrap

## Setting Up

First install global npm package dependencies

```cli
npm install -g jest-cli webpack webpack-dev-server json-server esdoc
```

Then install local npm packages by running the following from project root
directory where `package.json` resides.

```cli
npm install
```

To test that the environment is working properly run the following.

```cli
npm run build
```

Or run `npm start` if you want lint, test, build, and dev server.
